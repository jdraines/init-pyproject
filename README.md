# init-pyproject

A tool to scaffold a Python project including a `pyproject.toml` file.

## Installation

Install the package locally (editable mode is useful for development):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Run the tool with:

```bash
init-pyproject MyProject
```

This command will create a src directory with a subdirectory for your sanitized project name, a test directory, and a generated pyproject.toml file based on the template.
